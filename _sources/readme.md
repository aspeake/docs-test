# BuildStock Projections
The buildstock-projections tool generates inputs to [ResStock](https://github.com/NREL/resstock) and [ComStock](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/comstock.html) for use in simulation of future building stock scenarios.

For more information on our methodology, installation, and running read the [documentation](https://aspeake.github.io/docs-test/readme.html)
